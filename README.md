- **Docker Integration**: Run the application and its dependencies in isolated containers.
- **Makefile**: Simplify common tasks like building, testing, and running the application.
- **Database Migrations**: Manage database schema changes with ease.
- **Configuration Management**: Use `local.yaml` for environment-specific configurations.
